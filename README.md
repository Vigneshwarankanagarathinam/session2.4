Session 2: Hadoop Framework Description
Assignment 4
1.	Hadoop in Layman’s term:
•	Storage: HDFS (Hadoop Distributed File System), HBase.
•	Processing: Pig, Hive, Spark.
2.	Components of Hadoop Framework:
	Hadoop 1.x framework consists of two main layers, namely
	Distributed file system (HDFS) 
	 Execution engine (MapReduce)
•	In HDFS we have three Daemons,
	Master Daemon -NameNode
	Backup Master Daemon -Secondary NameNode
	Slave Daemons -DataNode
•	In MapReduce we have two Daemons,
	Master Daemon -Resource Manager
	Slave daemons -Node Manager
•	Hadoop 2.x framework consists of layers same as of Hadoop 1.x but consists of an additional framework called YARN(Yet Another Resource Negotiator).
•	Hadoop 2.x has three more Nodes acting as Master Nodes namely,
	Node Manager
	Application Master
	Data Node
•	Hadoop 2.x has two slave Nodes namely,
	Node Manager
	HDFS
3.	Main reasons to learn Big Data technologies:
•	No sign of slowing down ( e.g., since 2012 about 2.5 exabytes of data are created daily)
•	Big Data started to be used by everyone and everywhere.
•	Huge demand for Information Management(that is next stage  of Information Technology) 
•	Cost of entry is minimum as there are lot of open sources such as Apache Hadoop.
•	User can expand their data analysis skills as Big Data is into more than just numbers.
